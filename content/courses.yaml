  fall_2025:
    - code: "LING-L 235 / LING-L 555"
      title: "Foundational Skills in Computational Linguistics / Programming for Computational Linguistics"
      instructor: "Luke Gessler"
      description: "This course is geared towards students in Computational Linguistics and Linguistics, with little or no experience in programming. It introduces the fundamentals of programming and computer science, aiming at attaining practical skills for text processing. In contrast to similar courses in Computer Science, we will concentrate on problems in Computational Linguistics, which involve managing text, searching in text, and extracting information from text."
    - code: "LING-L 245"
      title: "Language and Computers"
      instructor: "Sandra Kuebler"
      description: "Present-day computer systems work with human language. This course surveys issues relating natural language to computers, covers real-world applications, and provides practical experience with natural language on computers. Topics include text encoding, search technology, machine translation, dialogue systems, computer-aided language learning, and the social context of technology."
    - code: "LING-L 545"
      title: "Computation and Linguistic Analysis"
      instructor: "Shuju Shi"
      description: "This course is a graduate course that provides an introduction to natural language processing and computational linguistics. The course focuses on key concepts, models, and algorithms for the automatic analysis and generation of natural language, with a look at real-world NLP applications."
    - code: "LING-L 635"
      title: "Applications of Speech Processing"
      instructor: "Shuju Shi"
      description: "This course explores advanced topics and current trends in speech processing, focusing on applications in areas such as speech recognition, synthesis, and speech enhancement. The course will cover both theoretical foundations and practical implementation aspects, including recent advances in machine learning and deep learning as applied to speech processing."
    - code: "LING-L 645"
      title: "Advanced Natural Language Processing"
      instructor: "Damir Cavar"
      description: "An introduction to statistical models and machine learning paradigms in NLP. Covers basic notions in probability and information theory, focusing on the concepts needed for NLP, including Markov Models. Additional topics may include word sense disambiguation, text categorization, and statistical alignment methods and their use in machine translation."
    - code: "LING-L 665"
      title: "Applying Machine Learning Techniques in Computational Linguistics"
      instructor: "Luke Gessler"
      description: "An introduction to machine learning (ML) methods for computational linguistics (CL). We begin by covering basic concepts in ML before turning to foundational ML methods in CL. Throughout, students develop practical skills in ML programming in Python, relying on libraries such as NumPy, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Students will develop an understanding of the mathematical details underlying modern models used in CL, and will have practical skills for creating and using ML models for CL."
    - code: "LING-L 715"
      title: "Seminar: Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, RAGs, and Graph-based Reasoning"
      instructor: "Damir Cavar"
