30 credit hours, to include:

* LING-L 541  Introductory Phonetics
* LING-L 542  Phonological Analysis
* LING-L 543  Syntactic Analysis
* LING-L 545  Computation and Linguistic Analysis
* LING-L 645  Advanced Natural Language Processing

Students must also fulfill a specialization course requirement by taking two of the following courses:

* LING-L 614  Alternative Syntactive Theories
* LING-L 615  Corpus Linguistics
* PSY-P 657 Machine Learning
* ILS-Z 543 Computer Mediated Communication
* LING-L 715  Computational Linguistics
* LING-L 700  Linguistics Seminar

Three additional electives must be taken. Electives must be approved by the student's advisor, but will typically be courses relevant to computational linguistics, in Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Psychology, Speech and Hearing, or the School of Informatics. A minimum of 20 credit hours must be from linguistics department offerings. All specialization courses and electives must be approved by the student's advisor.

## Programming Language Requirement

LING-L 555 Programming for Computational Linguists, or a computer programming course (or the equivalent) approved by the department

## Language Structure Requirement
Knowledge of the structure of a language or languages other than English and outside the student's general language family. This requirement is equivalent to that for the general M.A. in linguistics.
