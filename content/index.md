<p class="intro">
<strong>IU Computational Linguistics</strong> is a group of faculty, student, and staff researchers based in <a href="https://bloomington.iu.edu/">Indiana University Bloomington</a>'s <a href="https://linguistics.indiana.edu/">Department of Linguistics</a>.
We work with natural language using computational methods in order to investigate scientific questions about language and build intelligent systems for processing language.
Our areas of strength include <strong>natural language processing (NLP)</strong>, <strong>speech processing</strong>, <strong>corpus linguistics</strong>, <strong>low-resource NLP</strong>, and more.
